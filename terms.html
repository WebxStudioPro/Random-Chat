        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026</div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h3>1. Introduction & Agreement</h3>
            <p>Welcome to our high-speed Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Random Chat network ("Service", "Platform", "We", "Us"). By accessing, browsing, or utilizing our connection engine, you ("User", "You") acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be legally bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any clause stated herein, you must immediately disconnect and leave this website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h3>2. Strict Eligibility (18+ Only)</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>AGE RESTRICTION:</strong> This platform is strictly designed for adults. You must be exactly <b>eighteen (18) years of age or older</b> to access this network.</p>
            </div>
            <p>By proceeding to use the Service, you legally affirm and warrant that you meet this age requirement and are fully capable of understanding and assuming the legal liabilities outlined in these terms. We do not knowingly permit minors to use this service. If a minor circumvents this agreement, the legal guardians assume full responsibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h3>3. Nature of Service: The P2P Architecture</h3>
            <p>It is crucial to understand the technological architecture of our service. Unlike traditional chat applications that route and save data through central databases, our platform operates on direct WebRTC technology.</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><b>ZERO DATA RETENTION:</b> Our server functions purely as a signaling matchmaking engine. Once a connection is established, an encrypted, direct tunnel is created between your device and the stranger's device. <b>We DO NOT monitor, intercept, host, record, or store your text messages, image exchanges, audio notes, or personal identity.</b> Because data is never saved on our backend, we cannot retrieve or provide past chat logs to you or any third party.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h3>4. User Conduct & Zero-Tolerance Policy</h3>
            <p>While we cannot monitor private P2P tunnels, our system employs dynamic network-level security and background radar protocols to monitor the health and safety of the matchmaking lobby. You agree <b>NOT</b> to engage in the following prohibited activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Harassing, threatening, or abusing other connected peers.</li>
                <li>Distributing illegal, explicit, or non-consensual imagery.</li>
                <li>Attempting to blackmail, extort, or scam other users.</li>
                <li>Using automated scripts (bots) to spam the matchmaking engine.</li>
                <li>Attempting to reverse-engineer, DDoS, or disrupt our signaling servers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Violation of these rules will result in an <b>immediate, automated, and permanent IP and Device ban</b> from the network via our Admin security protocols, without prior notice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h3>5. Third-Party Services and Advertisements</h3>
            <p>To sustain the high-speed server infrastructure and provide this service for free, we partner with third-party advertising networks (such as Adsterra). We do not control, endorse, or claim liability for the products, external links, or services shown in these advertisements. Clicking on any third-party ad is done at your own absolute discretion and risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h3>6. Limitation of Liability & Indemnification</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>ZERO DEVELOPER LIABILITY:</strong> Because all communication is direct (User-to-User), the developers, owners, administrators, and hosting providers of this platform are completely indemnified from any disputes arising between users.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including emotional distress, fraud, or loss of privacy) resulting from your interactions on this platform. You use the service entirely at your own risk. The service is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including server uptime or connection stability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h3>7. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with international cyber laws and the local jurisdiction of the platform operators. Any disputes arising from the use of the platform's matchmaking engine shall be subject to exclusive resolution within our registered jurisdiction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h3>8. Amendments to the Terms</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify, amend, or update these Terms of Service at any time to reflect technological upgrades, legal compliance, or operational changes. Continued use of the platform after updates indicates your acknowledgment and acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
